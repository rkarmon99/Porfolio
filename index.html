I am looking to bring my well-honed public relations, marketing, and client-focused interpersonal communication skills to an inside sales role.

Iâ€™ve pitched stories for C-level executives via phone and email and placed them in major media outlets, such as MSNBC, "CIO Magazine," Sirius Satellite Radio, MSN Money, "AARP Bulletin," and "The New York Daily News." The ability to reach key audiences. As a journalist, I published stories for print and online publications, including CareerJournal.com, CollegeJournal.com, and StartupJournal.com (online publications of "The Wall Street Journal"), "Consumers Digest," "Woman's Day," and "ePregnancy Magazine." As a copywriter, my work has been used in email marketing, online and offline advertisements, blogs, brochures, taglines, and websites. Strong financial aptitude.
